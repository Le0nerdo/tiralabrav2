# Implementation document

## Project Structure.
The game state class takes care of the game state, and information related to it (isFull, isWinningMove...) and the NegmaxAI class calculates the next move from a given game state. All other classes/files exist only for visualization.

## Implemented time and space complexities
When I am closer to the end of the project, I will ask help to determine this.

The performance (speed) is low. The program can not realistically calculate hard early game moves.

## Sources
I am using Pascal Pons [Blog](http://blog.gamesolver.org/) as a guide.
