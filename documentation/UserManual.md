## Installation
Unfortunately, you have to host the website, because of CORS policies. I used `npm` with `http-server`, you can use something else.
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/Le0nerdo/tiralabrav2.git
cd tiralabrav2
npm install
```

## Usage
```cmd
npm run localhost
# The website should be available under http://localhost:8080/
# When you refresh a starting state is picked by random.
```
