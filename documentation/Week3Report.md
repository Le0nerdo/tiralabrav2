# Week 3 Report
I used 7 hours this week.

## What have you done this week related to the project?
* Applied alpha-beta pruning.
* Made an overcomplicated piece of spaghetti to create a new order for evaluating moves.
* Fixed some old code.
* Stupid programming mistakes.
* A somewhat pointless Testing Documentation

## How has the project progressed?
It is nice that, negamax can calculate some values correctly now. Let's not talk about the time needed to calculate the values.

## What did you learn this week?
I was reminded that there are no mistakes that are so stupid that I could not make them.

## What has been unclear or problematic?
Yes, I am problematic :)

## What next?
Getting negamax to be faster.

## Other
My food is getting cold. I should probably finish this.
