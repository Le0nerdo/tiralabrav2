# Project Specification
> The project is to make an AI that plays [connect 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four).

My goal for the course is to pass it and learn. I am ready to sacrifice my grade for learning.

## Programming Language
In this project, I use JavaScript (I prioritize speed over type safety). I have recently used JavaScript, TypeScript, Java and Python (mentioned for peer review).

## Data Structures and Algorithms
I will use a lot of list as data structures and a Minmax algorithm(with alpha-beta pruning) for the AI. Because I am a university student I use fancy words for brute force.

I chose this project in order to get familiar with this type of algorithms, before I need to use them for more complex problems.

## Input/Outpu
The user is able to select different versions of the AI that play against each other. Maybe I will also add that the user can play. The user gets a visual output in the form of a game board with disks that come in two different colours.

## Time Complexity
I will try to make the AI calculate as many moves in advance as possible in under 1 second. I chose 1 second, because after that the user is most likely already bored. (Yes I failed this.)

## Sources
I am using Pascal Pons [Blog](http://blog.gamesolver.org/) as a guide.
