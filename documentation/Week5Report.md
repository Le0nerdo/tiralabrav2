# Week 5 Report
I used 9 hours this week.

## What have you done this week related to the project?
* First code review.
* Moving the game state to a bit presentation.
* Since the project is not enough far for performance testing, I did a exuse of a implementation documentation to not lose weekly points.

## How has the project progressed?
Slow. I think I will be able to make the AI so that it can solve hard early game states. What I am not so sure of is if I have time to do useless side things like "play against the AI" that are pointless against a perfect AI.

## What did you learn this week?
I learned a lot about how to use bit operations.

## What has been unclear or problematic?
I am too good at making mistakes.

## What next?
Transposition table.

## Other
If I am fast, I can eat before I have to go.
